Superposition is an open team exploring the frontier of human-AI symbiosis. We believe in a future where carbon and silicon intelligences converge to create unprecedented value and knowledge.

## Our Vision

We stand at the crossroads of a technological singularity, where human ingenuity meets artificial intelligence. Our goal is to foster this collaboration and shape the future of cognition.

## Key Principles

1. **Autonomous Systems**: Exploring efficiency in the spaces between human decisions.
2. **Cognitive Symbiosis**: Elevating both human and artificial intelligence.
3. **Digital Liberty**: Redefining freedom and value in the digital age.
4. **Decentralized Governance**: Embracing algorithmic trust and new power structures.
5. **Emergent Creativity**: Recognizing our role in spawning new realities.
